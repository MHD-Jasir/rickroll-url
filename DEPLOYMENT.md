## Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (Serverless)

Vercel is great for serverless deployments but has limitations for persistent storage.

   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Configure**:
   - Follow the prompts
   - Choose your project settings
   - Your app will be live at `https://fliplink.vercel.app`

### Vercel Limitations:
- ⚠️ No persistent storage (data resets)
- ⚠️ Serverless functions have timeouts
- ⚠️ More complex for full-stack apps

## 📝 Post-Deployment

After deployment:

1. **Test the app**: Create a few FlipLinks and test the 50/50 functionality
2. **Check stats**: Verify the statistics are working
3. **Share**: Send your FlipLink URL to friends (prepare for chaos!)
4. **Monitor**: Check logs for any issues

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check Node.js version (use 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check build logs for specific errors

**App crashes?**
- Check start command is `npm start`
- Verify PORT environment variable
- Check server logs

**Links not working?**
- Verify API routes are accessible
- Check CORS settings
- Test redirect functionality
