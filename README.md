# üé≤ FlipLink - The 50/50 Surprise URL Shortener üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: **mulearners**

### Team Members

* **Team Lead**: Akshay K A ‚Äì MAMO College
* **Member 2**: Muhammed Jasir E ‚Äì MAMO College

### Project Description

FlipLink is a chaotic URL shortener that gives you a 50/50 chance of reaching your intended website or being Rickrolled. It‚Äôs built for fun, randomness, and a healthy dose of internet mischief.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Sometimes clicking a link is too predictable. Where‚Äôs the thrill? Where‚Äôs the chaos? Life‚Äôs too short to always end up where you expect.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A URL shortener that adds suspense to every click. Half the time, you‚Äôll get where you want‚Ä¶ and the other half, you‚Äôll be enjoying Rick Astley‚Äôs greatest hit.
